Please fill in answers to the questions below:


1. What's your name?
Jaime Kvaternik

2. Which VPS & domain providers did you choose?
VPS: Vultr, Domain Provider: Joker

3. What domain name did you register?
jk-web.site

4. What's the URL of your Github repository for this assignment?
https://github.com/jkvaternik/cs4550-hw01

5. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
I feel like I struggled with this assignment more than I was supposed 
to... The nginx config was confusing at first and I wasn't sure why I 
kept getting a 404 error. At first, I thought that the files would be 
reached as if I was testing a development server â€” through the local 
machine. Once I realized that this was not the case, the rest was 
pretty straightforward. There were other small misinterpretations 
like that that caused me to take longer on this assignment than I 
should have. Hopefully this isn't a recurring issue. 

NOTE: I committed to the git repo from my macOSX for the status.txt 
file and the other files from the VM. That's why there's two 'Jaime 
Kvaternik's.
